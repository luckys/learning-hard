## Forum UI mockups

The forum experience is inspired by the following screens:

\![Create Thread](/images/forum-create-thread.png)
\![Manage Categories](/images/forum-manage-categories.png)
\![Sign In](/images/forum-sign-in.png)
\![Thread List](/images/forum-thread-list.png)
\![Thread View](/images/forum-thread-view.png)

These visuals guide the Tailwind design decisions throughout the tutorial.
